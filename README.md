A mini IMDB clone app in which we can search movies based on OMDB API, with search suggestions. Clicking on a particular movie title opens a new movie page for more info. On clicking on the heart in search, we can add/remove a movie to the favourite list , which is using local storage to store movies. If the heart is red that means movie is added whereas if it is transparent that means movie is not added to the favourite list.In the nav bar we have two options one is Home which will redirect us to index.html and other is favourities which rediect us to favourities.html to view the list of favourites. Opening the favourities.html where all the favourites list is avaliable also a heart button is there clicking on which we can remove the movie from favourities and upon clicking on the movie title we can view the whole movie details.
